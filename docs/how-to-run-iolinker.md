# Performance and Requirements

- **High Concurrency**: Using synchronous/asynchronous API workflows (fast workflow mode) on a single machine, the **QPS can reach over 1500**.

- **High Capacity**: The Crontab workflow supports over **100,000** concurrent active workflows.

- **Low Resource Consumption**: Low hardware requirements; the system can run on a machine with 1 core and 1GB of memory or more.

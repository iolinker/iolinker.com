Globally capture exceptions or errors thrown during the workflow execution. As shown in the figure below, when the error trigger catches an exception during the workflow execution, it can initiate a new exception handling branch to continue the process. Here, the business can independently respond to the captured exception information, such as sending alerts, etc.
